# Contributing to Agentic Project Management (APM)

Thank you for considering contributing to APM! Your contributions help build a better framework for AI-assisted project management.

## Ways to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs & Workflow Issues

- **Search existing issues** first: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management/issues)
- **For new bug reports**, include:
  - APM CLI version (run `apm --version` or `npm list -g agentic-pm`)
  - Node.js and npm versions (run `node --version` and `npm --version`)
  - AI assistant used (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Antigravity, or OpenCode)
  - Agent type experiencing issues (Planner, Manager, or Worker)
  - Step-by-step reproduction of the issue (if possible, otherwise a detailed description)
  - Expected vs actual behavior

### Suggesting Features & Improvements

- Workflow improvements: procedures, coordination patterns, memory system optimizations
- Documentation improvements: clearer explanations, additional examples, missing use cases
- Platform support: better integration with supported assistants
- Build system: placeholder additions, platform-specific enhancements

### High-Priority Areas

**Workflow Testing & Feedback**
- Run APM sessions on real projects and report issues via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management/issues)
- Test across different assistants and model combinations
- Identify edge cases in coordination, Handoff, and session continuation

**Template Standards**
- Help improve the template authoring standards in `templates/_standards/`
- Resources: WORKFLOW.md, TERMINOLOGY.md, STRUCTURE.md, WRITING.md
- Contributions needed: compliance findings, writing improvements, structural refinements

**Standalone Skills**
- The `skills/` directory contains standalone skills installed independently from APM bundles
- Current skills: [apm-assist](skills/apm-assist/) (APM assistant, migration, docs), [apm-customization](skills/apm-customization/) (repo customization)
- Contributions welcome for new standalone skills that complement the APM workflow

### Community Contributions

- Share adaptations: domain-specific customizations via custom repositories
- Best practices: cost optimization strategies, effective coordination patterns
- Case studies: real project examples using APM

### Community Extensions

APM officially supports Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Antigravity, and OpenCode. For other assistants (e.g. Windsurf, Kilo Code, Roo Code), community members may develop and maintain unofficial extensions.

Community extensions are not officially supported, may lag behind releases, and should be tested thoroughly before use. If you're interested in developing or maintaining an extension, please open an issue to discuss.

## Contribution Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/agentic-project-management.git
   cd agentic-project-management
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/description-of-change
   ```

### Making Changes

APM uses a build system that processes source templates into platform-specific bundles. Understanding where to make changes is important:

#### File Locations

- **Templates (commands, guides, skills, agents):** Edit files in `templates/`. This is the core deliverable. All template changes must comply with `templates/_standards/`.
- **Build system:** Edit files in `build/` for processors, config, and generators.
- **CLI source:** Edit files in `src/` for CLI command behavior.
- **Standalone skills:** Edit files in `skills/` for independently installable skills.
- **Documentation:** Docs live in a separate repository: [apm-website](https://github.com/sdi2200262/apm-website) (`docs/` directory). Video walkthroughs covering the v1 workflow are needed. See the apm-website README for details.

**Important:** Template changes follow a top-down propagation. Workflow changes start in `WORKFLOW.md`, then propagate to affected commands, guides, and skills. See the change propagation rules in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

#### Building

After modifying files in `templates/` or `build/`, run:

```bash
npm run build:release
```

This processes templates and creates platform-specific bundles in `dist/`.

### Testing Your Changes

**For template changes** (`templates/`):
- Run `npm run build:release` to verify the build completes
- Test with actual AI assistants in a real project
- Include example interactions or observations in your PR to speed review

**For CLI or build system changes** (`src/` or `build/`):
- Run `npm run build:release` to verify build output
- Test CLI commands manually
- Verify generated output in `dist/` is correct

### Pull Requests

1. Ensure your changes are tested.
2. Commit with clear messages following the conventions in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
3. Push your branch and create a Pull Request with a clear description.
4. Reference related issues if applicable.
5. Include test instructions for template changes.

### Versioning Considerations

APM uses a decoupled versioning system where the CLI and templates version independently but share the same major version number. See [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) for details.
