# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for the **core CLI package** published on NPM.

> **Note:** APM uses a decoupled versioning system. The CLI (`agentic-pm` on NPM) and template releases (GitHub Releases) version independently but share major version for compatibility. This changelog primarily tracks CLI changes, but major template releases may also be noted. See [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) for full details.

## [1.0.2] - Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

* **Gemini CLI Migration:** Transitioned support from Gemini CLI to the new Antigravity platform. The configuration directory has moved from `.gemini` to `.agents`, and the rules file has been renamed from `GEMINI.md` to `AGENTS.md`. Output format has been updated from TOML to Markdown.

### Added

* **Antigravity Support:** Full support for the new Antigravity (CLI and IDE), including optimized directory structure (`.agents/workflows/`, `.agents/skills/`) and agent-first subagent guidance.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

* **Codex CLI fixes:** Resolved issues with Codex CLI command invocation and path handling.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-12

v1.0.0 is a complete redesign of the APM workflow. The scope of changes across both the codebase and the workflow itself is too large to cover exhaustively here. This is a concise summary of the most significant changes. For the full specification, see the [documentation](https://github.com/sdi2200262/apm-website/tree/main/docs).

### Breaking Changes

* **Workflow redesigned.** Two-phase workflow: Planning Phase (Context Gathering + Work Breakdown) produces three planning documents (Spec, Plan, Rules). Implementation Phase cycles through Task Assignment, Task Execution, Task Logging, and Task Review, with support for batch and parallel dispatch across multiple Workers. All coordination is User-mediated through a file-based Message Bus, with Agents guiding the User at every step.

* **Agent roles changed.** Setup Agent → Planner. Implementation Agent → Worker. Ad-Hoc Agents removed (subagents are now spawned natively by Planner, Manager, and Workers). Manager unchanged.

* **9 commands** (up from 5): `apm-1-initiate-planner`, `apm-2-initiate-manager`, `apm-3-initiate-worker`, `apm-4-check-tasks`, `apm-5-check-reports`, `apm-6-handoff-manager`, `apm-7-handoff-worker`, `apm-8-summarize-session`, `apm-9-recover`.

* **New artifact structure.** Spec (`.apm/spec.md`), Plan with dependency graphs (`.apm/plan.md`), Rules (platform rules file), Tracker (`.apm/tracker.md`), Memory hierarchy (`.apm/memory/` with Index, Task Logs, Handoff Logs). Replaces Implementation Plan and Memory Root.

* **Platform support narrowed** to Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Antigravity, and OpenCode.

* **Template file structure changed.** Commands in `templates/commands/`, guides in `templates/guides/`, skills in `templates/skills/`, agents in `templates/agents/`. Governed by `templates/_standards/` (WORKFLOW.md, TERMINOLOGY.md, STRUCTURE.md, WRITING.md).

* **CLI redesigned.** New commands: `apm archive`, `apm add`, `apm remove`, `apm status`, `apm custom`. `apm init` is fresh-install only. Per-file install tracking via `installedFiles` in metadata.

* **Decoupled versioning.** CLI and templates version independently. Template releases use standard SemVer. See [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md).

### Added

* **Message Bus** (`.apm/bus/`): file-based Agent communication with Task Bus, Report Bus, and Handoff Bus per Worker.
* **Session continuation:** archive completed sessions, start fresh with archived context carried forward via Planner detection.
* **Recovery command** (`/apm-9-recover`): reconstructs working context after platform auto-compaction.
* **Handoff system:** structured context transfer between Agent instances with Handoff Log (persistent) and Handoff Prompt (ephemeral).
* **Standalone skills** (`skills/`): independently installable skills for migration and customization.
* **Custom repository support** (`apm custom`): install templates from forked or third-party repositories.
* **Build pipeline** (`build/`): processes templates into platform-specific bundles with placeholder system, TOML conversion for Gemini, and `apm-release.json` manifest.
* **Modular CLI architecture** (`src/`): commands, services, core, UI, and schemas modules.

### Removed

* Ad-Hoc Agents and Delegate commands.
* Implementation Plan, Memory Root, and `guides/` directory format.
* Support for Windsurf, Kilo Code, Roo Code, Auggie CLI, Google Antigravity, and Qwen Code.
* Legacy build system (`scripts/build.js`).

---

## [0.5.4] - 2026-01-24

### Added

* **Google Antigravity Support:** Added support for Google Antigravity as the 11th AI assistant.

### Deprecated

* **Bootstrap Prompt:** The Bootstrap Prompt has been deprecated and will be removed in v1.0.0.

---

## [0.5.3] - 2025-12-05

### Fixed

* **NPM Package:** Fixed `.npmignore` to exclude `dist/` directory from published package. Previous releases (v0.5.2 and earlier) incorrectly included build artifacts (zip files) in the npm package.

---

## [0.5.2] - 2025-11-26

### Added

* **Header Templates:** CLI now creates `Implementation_Plan.md` and `Memory_Root.md` with pre-filled header templates containing placeholders. Setup Agent must fill Implementation Plan header before Project Breakdown, and Manager Agent must fill Memory Root header before first phase execution.

### Changed

* **Workflow Streamlining:** Removed Enhancement phase and `Implementation_Plan_Guide.md`. Setup workflow now consists of 4 steps instead of 5, with structured file format built directly into Project Breakdown Guide.
* **Context Synthesis:** Renamed terminology from "Phase" to "Question Round" with stricter sequence enforcement and mandatory completion requirements.
* **Error Handling:** Strengthened Implementation Agent error handling protocol with 3-attempt limit before mandatory delegation (increased from 2 attempts).
* **Project Breakdown:** Added stricter instructions for interleaved Project Breakdown sequence with strict guardrails to prevent pattern matching and ensure quality task breakdown.
* **Task Assignment:** Added Reporting Protocol requiring Implementation Agents to output Final Task Report code blocks for better UX.
* **Agent Management:** Added Agent Name Registration & Assignment Validation protocol for Implementation Agents to prevent task assignment errors.

### Removed

* **Implementation_Plan_Guide.md:** Removed separate Enhancement guide. Structured format now integrated directly into Project Breakdown Guide workflow.

---

## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-29

### Added

* **NPM CLI Tool (`agentic-pm`):** Introduced a command-line interface for managing APM installations.
* **`apm init` Command:** Automates project setup, including AI assistant selection, asset download from GitHub Releases, and creation of the `.apm` directory structure (`.apm/guides`, `.apm/Memory`, `.apm/Implementation_Plan.md`, `.apm/metadata.json`). By default, automatically finds and installs the latest template version compatible with the current CLI version. Supports `--tag <tag>` option for installing specific template versions (e.g., `apm init --tag v0.5.0+templates.1`).
* **`apm update` Command:** Allows users to update their local APM installation to the latest compatible template version. Includes intelligent version compatibility checking that compares installed templates against available releases, only updating if a newer compatible build exists. Informs users when newer templates require a CLI update via `npm update -g agentic-pm`. Includes backup and restore functionality for safe updates.
* **Version Compatibility System:** Dynamic CLI version reading from `package.json` with automatic template version matching. The CLI automatically finds templates compatible with the running CLI version and compares build numbers for update decisions.
* **Support for 10 AI Assistants:** CLI downloads and installs specific bundles tailored for Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Antigravity, Qwen Code, OpenCode, Windsurf, Kilo Code, Auggie CLI, and Roo Code.
* **Build Process (`npm run build`):** New script (`scripts/build.js`) processes source templates (`templates/`) into distributable bundles (`dist/`) for each assistant, handling formatting (Markdown/TOML) and placeholders.
* **Metadata File (`.apm/metadata.json`):** Tracks the installed APM version (template tag) and selected AI assistant within the project.
* **`Troubleshooting_Guide.md`:** Added a dedicated guide based on the v0.4 User Guide's troubleshooting section.

### Changed

* **Installation Method:** APM is now installed via NPM (`npm install agentic-pm`) instead of Git clone or GitHub Template.
* **Customization Workflow:** Customization is now done by editing files locally within the `.apm/guides/` directory or the assistant-specific command directory *after* running `apm init`. Acknowledged as a work-in-progress for improving flexibility.
* **Source File Structure:** Core prompt and guide templates moved to the `templates/` directory in the repository. The `/prompts` directory is no longer the source or user-facing structure.
* **Prompt/Guide Compliance:** Updated all agent initiation prompts, handover prompts, and core guides (`Memory_System`, `Memory_Log`, `Task_Assignment`, `Implementation_Plan`, `Project_Breakdown`, `Context_Synthesis`) to be v0.5 compliant:
    * Removed all instructions related to actions now handled by the CLI (e.g., Asset Verification).
    * Added CLI awareness to the Setup Agent.
    * Removed all references to JSON assets.
    * Removed all references to the Simple Memory system.
* **File Re-branding & Relocation:**
    * `Context_Synthesis_Prompt.md` re-branded to `Context_Synthesis_Guide.md` and moved conceptually to the guides directory.
    * `Manager_Agent_Handover_Guide.md` re-branded to `Manager_Agent_Handover_Prompt.md` with command name `handover-manager`.
    * `Implementation_Agent_Handover_Guide.md` re-branded to `Implementation_Agent_Handover_Prompt.md` with command name `handover-implementation`.
* **Documentation Update:** Updated `README.md` (main), `docs/README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `Getting_Started.md`, `Introduction.md`, `Workflow_Overview.md`, `Modifying_APM.md`, `Agent_Types.md`, and `Token_Consumption_Tips.md` to reflect all v0.5 changes, including CLI usage, new file structures, deprecations, and customization workflow. Removed references to now-obsolete PDF guides.

### Deprecated

* **JSON Asset Format:** No longer supported for Implementation Plans or Memory Logs.
* **Simple Memory Bank:** The single-file `Memory_Bank.md` strategy is no longer supported. APM v0.5 exclusively uses the Dynamic-MD system.

### Removed

* **GitHub Template:** The "Use this template" approach for installation and customization is removed in favor of the CLI.
* **User-facing `/prompts` Directory:** The structured `/prompts` directory is no longer part of the user installation; assets are placed directly by the CLI.
* **PDF Guides:** `APM_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf` and `APM_User_Guide.pdf` are removed from the documentation set; relevant content integrated into Markdown files.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-08-19

APM v0.4 represents a complete framework refinement. The v0.3 architecture is enhanced to provide a more sophisticated, scalable approach to multi-agent project management while maintaining the core principles that made APM effective.

### Major Changes

**Architecture Enhancements**
- **Expanded from 2 to 4 agent types**: Added Setup Agent for project initialization and Ad-Hoc Agents for specialized delegation
- **Two-phase workflow**: Setup Phase for comprehensive planning, Task Loop Phase for execution
- **Advanced memory system**: Dynamic Memory Bank with multiple variants and progressive creation
- **Sophisticated dependency management**: Cross-agent coordination with comprehensive context integration
- **Handovers are now practical context repair mechanisms** not just context dumps, with built-in safety and validation steps

**Complete File Structure Overhaul**
- All prompts redesigned and reorganized under new directory structure
- New `docs/` directory with comprehensive updated documentation
- Added `schemas/` directory with experimental JSON asset format for testing/research preview

**Enhanced Capabilities**
- **Systematic project discovery**: 4-phase Context Synthesis with progression gates

## [0.3.0] - 2025-05-21

### Added
- New section in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Handover_Artifact_Format.md` for "Recent Conversational Context & Key User Directives" in the `Handover_File.md`.

### Changed
- **Memory System Robustness (High Priority):**
  - Updated `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md` to mandate strict adherence to `Implementation_Plan.md` for all directory/file naming and to include a validation step before creation. Phase and Task naming conventions clarified.
  - Significantly revised `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md` to emphasize conciseness, provide clear principles for achieving it, and added concrete examples of good vs. overly verbose log entries.
  - Updated `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/03_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md` to instruct Manager Agents to explicitly remind specialized agents of their obligations regarding Memory Bank structure and log quality (this earlier change remains valid alongside the newer one below).
- **Handover Protocol Enhancement:**
  - Modified `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/05_Handover_Protocol_Guide.md` to include a new mandatory step for the Outgoing Manager Agent: review recent conversational turns with the User and incorporate a summary of unlogged critical directives or contextual shifts into the handover artifacts.
- **Implementation Plan and Task Assignment Process:**
  - Enhanced `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/01_Implementation_Plan_Guide.md` to:
    - Emphasize and clarify the requirement for explicit agent assignment per task.
    - Mandate the inclusion of brief "Guiding Notes" (e.g., key methods, libraries, parameters) within task action steps to ensure inter-task consistency and provide clearer direction.
  - Updated `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/03_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md` to ensure Manager Agents incorporate and expand upon these "Guiding Notes" from the `Implementation_Plan.md` when creating detailed task assignment prompts for Implementation Agents.
- **Handover Artifacts Refinement:**
  - Restructured and clarified `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Handover_Artifact_Format.md` for better usability and understanding.

### Removed
- Removed the `Complex_Task_Prompting_Best_Practices.md` guide to maintain a more general framework.
- Removed explicit guidelines for Jupyter Notebook cell generation from `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Imlementation_Agent_Onboarding.md` to keep agent guidance general.
